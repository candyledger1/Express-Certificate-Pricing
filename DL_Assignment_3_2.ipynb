        "\n",
        "In digital marketplaces such as Airbnb, listing titles play a crucial role in attracting user attention and influencing click-through behavior. Since potential guests initially only see the listing title, it must clearly communicate key attributes such as location, property type, and standout features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this assignment is to develop an automated title generation system based on a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). The model is conditioned on Airbnb listing descriptions and trained to generate concise, attractive, and relevant titles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment consists of the following stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tTask A: Zero-shot title generation using a base LLM\n",
        "- \tTask B: Supervised fine-tuning (LoRA + 4-bit quantization)\n",
        "- \tTask C: Manual human preference labeling\n",
        "-\tTask D: Preference fine-tuning using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
        "-   Task E: Comparative evaluation and qualitative analysis\n",
        "-\tTask F: Deployment via a Gradio web application\n",

        "The results demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning substantially improves stylistic alignment and structural consistency compared to the zero-shot baseline.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the zero-shot model produces fluent and often creative titles, it shows greater variability in format and occasionally includes overly promotional or verbose phrasing. In contrast, both fine-tuned models generate more concise and structured outputs that better reflect Airbnb-style naming conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning appears to improve:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Consistency in title structure\n",
        "- Inclusion of relevant attributes (location, property type, room size)\n",
        "- Reduction of unnecessary stylistic variation\n",
        "\n",
        "Model 2 exhibits slightly stronger structural regularity and more focused phrasing than Model 1. This suggests that the modified training configuration (batch size, gradient accumulation, learning rate, and number of epochs) influences convergence behavior and output control.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings highlight the effectiveness of LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning under memory-efficient 4-bit quantization. Even without updating the full backbone model, adapter training is sufficient to meaningfully adapt generation behavior to a domain-specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, increased structural consistency may come at the cost of reduced stylistic diversity. This trade-off between creativity and alignment is typical in supervised fine-tuning and should be considered when optimizing generation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, supervised fine-tuning provides more controlled, consistent, and domain-aligned outputs than prompt-only optimization for this task."
